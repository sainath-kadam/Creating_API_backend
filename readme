#  steps:
#   npm init
# We need to install a few dependencies now.

# npm i express mongoose nodemon dotenv
# Here,

# Express will be used for the middleware to create various CRUD endpoints.
# Mongoose for managing data in MongoDB using various queries.
# Nodemon to restart our server every time we save our file.
# Dotenv to manage a .env file.


# add
# "start": "nodemon index.js"

# This means that we can start our server using npm start, and it will run using the Nodemon package that we previously installed.

# Now, let's configure the mongoDB Database.

# It will take some time for our cluster to finish, so let's wait. Meanwhile, create a file called .env in the project folder.
